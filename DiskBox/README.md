An External USB3 Disk Enclosure for 7mm disk. Another example of how trivial OpenScad can be.

The Box is designed and cut into two parts with a V slot. Rather than complicate the SCAD design
I decided to use KISS and simply split the produced stl into 2 parts using slic3r.

Print both parts at the same time, If you want a truly stunning looking box print in PLA and finish it with Pratliglo.
